# Tech Thought Portfolio

Repository for Chris McDermut's technical learning, writing, and presentation work. This workspace collects in-progress thinking, polished artifacts, and reference material in one place so ideas can move smoothly from exploration to publishable content.

## Structure
- `ai-learning/` — Hands-on AI/ML study notes, learning plans, experiments, and resource tracking.
- `tech-thought-leadership/` — Drafts and assets for articles, talks, and other externally-facing content.

Each area can evolve independently, but they share a common goal: document what was learned, distill the insight, then turn it into teachable material.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Capture raw learning in `ai-learning/` (notes, questions, experiments).
2. Summarize key takeaways or frameworks as they emerge.
3. Promote ideas into `tech-thought-leadership/` when they are ready for public storytelling or presentation.
4. Link related artifacts across folders so it is easy to trace an idea from first exposure to final narrative.

## Quick Links
- AI learning backlog and context: `ai-learning/README.md`
- Portfolio guidelines and templates: `tech-thought-leadership/README.md`

## Future Ideas
- Add project-level dashboards (Kanban, milestone trackers).
- Surface published work with links and publish dates.
- Track talk feedback or article revisions alongside source files.
