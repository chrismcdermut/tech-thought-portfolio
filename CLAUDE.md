# Context for AI Assistants

This repository captures Chris McDermut's technical learning pipeline and the polished artifacts that emerge from it. When assisting here, keep the following in mind:

## Purpose
- Support ongoing AI/ML study and experimentation (`ai-learning/`).
- Evolve raw insights into publishable articles, talks, or frameworks (`tech-thought-leadership/`).
- Maintain clear traceability from initial notes through to finished storytelling.

## Collaboration Preferences
- Favor succinct explanations paired with concrete next steps.
- Keep files in Markdown unless a different format is explicitly required.
- Default to ASCII characters and add comments only when they clarify non-obvious choices.
- Preserve any in-progress user edits; never revert unrelated changes.

## Suggested Workflow Support
1. Ensure new ideas start life in `ai-learning/` (notes, questions, experiments).
2. Help consolidate repeated themes into reusable frameworks or narratives.
3. When polishing content, surface open questions, feedback summaries, or publish-ready checklists.
4. Highlight opportunities to cross-link related notes, talks, or articles.
