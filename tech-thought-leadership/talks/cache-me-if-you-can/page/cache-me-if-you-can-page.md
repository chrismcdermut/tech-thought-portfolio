section_2_title_origin_story: The Napkin Math That Changed Everything
section_2_content_origin_story: "This talk started with a simple realization while building my SaaS product: inference costs would destroy my margins at scale. I did the napkin math - in a network effects platform, users often ask similar questions. If 100 users ask variations of the same query, why pay for 100 API calls? By caching responses and matching similar queries, I could theoretically cut inference costs by 70-90%. The economics were compelling: better unit economics meant I could price competitively while maintaining healthy SaaS margins. This strategic use of caching transformed AI from a cost center into a sustainable product feature."

# Cache Me If You Can: Optimizing AI Systems Through Intelligent Caching

## Talk Overview
In AI systems, caching isn't just about storing data - it's about intelligently managing expensive computations. This talk reveals how companies are using advanced caching strategies to make AI economically viable at scale. We'll explore semantic similarity caching for LLM responses, where similar queries retrieve cached completions. I'll share lessons from building distributed caches for embedding vectors, managing terabytes of cached model inferences, and coordinating cache invalidation across multi-region GPU deployments. The talk includes a deep dive into vector similarity search for cache lookups and strategies for caching non-deterministic AI outputs.

## Abstract
This talk explores the critical role of caching in modern AI and distributed ML systems. We'll examine how caching strategies can reduce LLM API costs by 80%, accelerate model inference through embedding caches, and enable real-time AI features at scale. Through case studies from production AI systems, attendees will learn about semantic caching for natural language queries, distributed caching for model weights, and managing cache coherence across GPU clusters. We'll also cover the unique challenges of caching in AI contexts: handling probabilistic outputs, versioning model responses, and invalidating caches when models are retrained.

## TL;DR
How simple caching strategies drastically reduce costs and latency in distributed AI inference systems

## Key Takeaways

### Simple Yet Powerful AI Caching Strategies
Caching in AI systems is surprisingly simple and elegant - store expensive computations and reuse them intelligently. We cover semantic caching where similar prompts retrieve cached LLM responses, embedding caches that store vector representations for instant similarity search, and inference result caching for deterministic model outputs. The talk demonstrates how these straightforward patterns can reduce latency from seconds to milliseconds and cut costs by orders of magnitude, making AI features economically viable at scale.

## Origin Story

### The Day We Saved $500K/Month with One Cache
This talk originated from a critical moment when our AI startup was hemorrhaging money on LLM API calls. Our GPT-4 costs were unsustainable - $20K daily for customer-facing features. The solution was elegantly simple: implement semantic caching. By storing responses and using vector similarity to match incoming queries to cached results, we achieved an 80% cache hit rate. The implementation took two days but reduced our costs to $4K daily. This experience proved that in distributed AI systems, caching isn't complex - it's about finding the right simple pattern for your use case.
