# Tech Thought Leadership

This space turns learning work into external artifacts—long-form articles, talks, workshops, and supporting materials. Use it to track ideas from outline to publication.

## Folder Layout
- `articles/` — Drafts, outlines, and published versions of written pieces. Include metadata blocks (title, status, target outlet) at the top of each Markdown file.
- `talks/` — Slide decks, speaker notes, and run-of-show plans for presentations or workshops. Keep any exported assets (PDF, Keynote, PowerPoint) in subfolders alongside source material.

## Suggested Workflow
1. Capture seed ideas or hooks as short notes in the relevant folder.
2. Add structure quickly: audience, problem, takeaway, and proof (story, demo, data).
3. Track status in the filename or front matter (`draft`, `in-review`, `published`).
4. Link back to origin material in `ai-learning/` so readers can trace the research lineage.

## Templates & Checklists
- Start new articles from a copy of `_template-article.md` if present; otherwise, sketch an outline that covers context, insight, and action.
- For talks, capture a one-slide story (setup → insight → outcome) before expanding into full slides.
- Maintain a lightweight changelog at the bottom of each piece once it enters review.

Keep files focused, versioned, and easy to pick up midstream so future edits remain low friction.
