# Proletariat NPM Package

## Package Overview
Proletariat solves the challenge of managing multiple concurrent development streams in modern software projects. As AI-assisted development becomes more prevalent, the need for tools that can coordinate multiple agents working on different features simultaneously has grown. This package provides the infrastructure to spawn, manage, and coordinate git worktrees, allowing multiple processes to work in isolation while maintaining consistency across the codebase.

## Key Information

**Date:** 2024-03-15  
**Audience:** Software Engineers, DevOps Teams, AI Tool Developers  
**Format:** NPM Package

## Abstract
Proletariat is an NPM package designed to revolutionize how developers manage multiple git worktrees. It enables coordination between multiple AI agents or automated processes working on the same codebase simultaneously, preventing conflicts and optimizing parallel development workflows. The package provides a robust API for worktree creation, synchronization, and cleanup, making it ideal for teams using AI-assisted development or running complex CI/CD pipelines.

## TL;DR
Multi-agent worktree management tool that orchestrates parallel git operations across multiple working directories for enhanced developer productivity

## Key Takeaways

### Core Capabilities
Proletariat offers intelligent worktree orchestration with automatic conflict detection, smart merge strategies for parallel changes, and a plugin architecture for custom workflows. It includes built-in support for popular AI coding assistants and provides comprehensive logging and monitoring of all worktree operations.

## Origin Story

### Why I Built This
While working with multiple AI coding assistants, I encountered frequent conflicts when different agents tried to modify the same codebase. Traditional git workflows weren't designed for this level of parallel automation. Proletariat emerged from the need to coordinate these AI workers effectively, treating each as a 'worker' in a distributed development system - hence the name inspired by the working class managing their own means of production.
