# Project Context

## Overview
This is Chris McDermut's personal AI/ML learning repository, combining theoretical study with practical implementation.

## Current Focus
- **Active Study**: LLM Survey paper, Henry Shi's AI crash course
- **Timeline**: 2-week sprint format (currently Week 1, Days 3-4)
- **Philosophy**: 30% theory, 70% implementation
- **Main Project**: CareerOps - AI-powered job search/scraping tool

## Learning Goals
1. Understand transformer architecture and LLM evolution (GPT â†’ GPT-4)
2. Apply AI patterns to CareerOps immediately
3. Build working prototypes for each concept learned
4. Focus on depth over breadth

## Key Projects
- **CareerOps**: Production AI agent for job searching/scraping
- **Learning Implementations**: Small Python demos for concepts (attention mechanisms, CoT, etc.)

## Study Resources
- Henry Shi's AI crash course (primary curriculum)
- LLM Survey paper
- Agent Survey paper  
- Prompt Engineering Survey
- Core papers: Transformers (2017), GPT-3 (2020), Chain of Thought (2022)

## Background
- Engineering Manager + Architecture background
- AWS experience
- Currently building with AI tools, seeking deeper understanding

## Preferences
- Practical > Theoretical when stuck
- VS Code + Obsidian for note-taking
- Quick implementation to solidify concepts
- Anti-procrastination: 30 min limit on theory before switching to code

## Commands to Know
- Test commands: TBD
- Build commands: TBD
- Lint/typecheck: TBD
